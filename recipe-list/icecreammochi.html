    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In need of a cool, refreshing treat in light of this summer heat? Look no further than the staple that is ice cream mochi!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 small scoops vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet rice flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch--or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find an empty egg carton and fit pieces of plastic wrap into 10 of the little container spaces.</li>
        <li>Scoop appropriately sized ice cream samples into the egg cups and wrap the plastic to completely cover them. Freeze until solid--at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Mix rice flour, water, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl. Add sugar in portions while stirring. Stop when completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover rice flour mixture bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes. After, stir the mixture, re-cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave again until the dough is thick and sticky--about 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust a work surface with cornstarch. Turn mochi dough out on prepared work surface. Roll dough into a 1/8-inch thick rectangle and cut it into 10 equal squares.</li>
        <li>Remove the frozen ice cream scoops from plastic wrap. Place 1 ice cream ball in the center of 1 mochi dough square. Gather mochi dough together to cover the ice cream ball completely, pinch the edges together at the base, and cut off any excess dough. Repeat with remaining ice cream and dough squares.</li>
        <li>Tightly cover each mochi in plastic wrap and put back into the egg carton. Freeze until firm--about 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
